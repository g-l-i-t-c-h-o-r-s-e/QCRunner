# Finally... 
a 32/64 bit compatible Quartz Composer composition compatible screensaver for MacOS Mojave!

# But thats not all
It also has an interactive mode, so you can do stuff with compositions at fullscreen with mouse and keyboard interaction! <br>
So it doubles as a viewing application for your 32bit and 32bit compositions on Mojave 10.14.6 <3

Shame this wasn't a option by default, but here we are.
