# Finally... 
a 32/64 bit compatible Quartz Composer composition compatible screensaver for MacOS Mojave!

# But thats not all
It also has an interactive mode, so you can do stuff with compositions at fullscreen with mouse and keyboard interaction! <br>
So it doubles as a viewing application for your 32bit and 64bit compositions on Mojave 10.14.6 <3

Shame this wasn't a option by default, but here we are.

# Important note
Before running the app, Please go to <br> 
`System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accesibility >` ... And then add QCRunner here. <br>
It needs this permission to be able to read mouse/keyboard input. <br>
If you are using a quartz composition that uses camera or microphone input, and for some reason your system does not request permission, try using [this script](https://gist.github.com/g-l-i-t-c-h-o-r-s-e/fe1e3215cde369806c9fef50e3b15b30) I made to manually force these permissions for any application.
